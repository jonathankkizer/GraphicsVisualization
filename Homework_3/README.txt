*** Processing Scripts ***

Ensure that the required .txt files are located in their respective directories (wordfrequency.txt in the a3_wordfrequency directory, and uniquewords.txt in the a3_novelvisualization directory)

Each .pde file should run successfully if these conditions are met; simply click "Run" after opening either. 

*** extract_words.py ***

Run extract_words.py in a directory including the novel "TheInvisibleMan.txt". The script requires Python 3+. It generates three .txt files: wordfrequency.txt, uniquewords.txt, and allwords.txt. Each are used for successive stages of the project.
