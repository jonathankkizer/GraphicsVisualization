Our scene represents a person walking, a dog walking, and trees growing/losing their leaves.

The Person class creates a group of PShapes that represent a Person, and then animates it such that it appears to walk. The subanimation is the arms moving.

The Tree class creates two PShapes that represent a tree trunk and a tree top, and then animates it such that it appears to grow and shrink over time. The subanimation is the treetop falling and turning fall-yellow, representing Fall. Tree additionally has the ability to move tree objects left or right, which was originally intended as a way to "scroll" the scene.
