To start the game, hit "play" in Processing. 

HOW TO PLAY:: Use the mouse to control a trail of bees. As bees randomly spawn, collect them to add them to your trail. Avoid the walls (canvas borders) and being hit by the birds, as they will eat your bees. You win by achieving a trail of 8 bees and lose when the "queen bee" (frontmost bee, the one) hits a bird or a wall. 

CONTROLS: 
	*Use the mouse to control the queen bee, the other bees will follow. 
	*p to pause/resume the game
	*1,2,3, and 4 to change the background color (white, the default color, is 1)
	*cheat code: up arrow to instantly add another bee in your trail

NOTE: Upon startung the game, move your cursor to be within the Processign canvas but not in the very center. The bees spawn in the center, and can instantly kill your queen bee if the queen bee is directly in the center.
