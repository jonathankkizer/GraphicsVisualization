Bee Game

To run, click "run" in Processing and select a level to start on. 

The game includes "cheat codes": Press UP key to add a bee, press DOWN key to get the power up effect. Spacebar activates the invincibility powerup if you have captured it. When in the game, press P to pause it.

The game mechanic is controlled with the mouse, and involves avoiding the birds and collecting other bees. Once you have collected at 10 bees, you move on to the next level.

The best times are recorded and displayed for each level.

In the main menu, clicking the sound icon toggles sound being off or on.
