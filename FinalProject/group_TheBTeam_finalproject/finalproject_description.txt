Controls:
To run, click "run" in Processing and select a level to start on. 

The game includes "cheat codes": Press UP key to add a bee, press DOWN key to get the power up effect. Spacebar activates the invincibility powerup if you have captured it. When in the game, press P to pause it.

The game mechanic is controlled with the mouse, and involves avoiding the birds and collecting other bees. Once you have collected at 10 bees, you move on to the next level.

Unexpected Challenges:
- Adding main menu functionality last was not ideal
- 1000+ line main .pde file made dealing with adding features difficult; in the future, would be better about componentizing levels 
- Performance issues when more than 5 birds and 10 bees are on screen (framerate would drop below 5 frames per second making game completely unplayable)
